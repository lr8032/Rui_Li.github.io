# Seek innovations in extracting, understanding, and fusing tacit human domain knowledge to advance image semantics interpretation in knowledge rich domains

We address two major challenges for computational gene regulatory network (GRN) inference. 
* The first challenge is that the topological structures of gene regulations are context-dependent. Different interactions of gene activities will be active in different experimental conditions (e.g., culture media, temperatures, pH), leading to a different topological structure of the inferred GRNs. 
* The second one is that aggregating gene expressions with their regulatory networks to infer new relationships in a supervised learning paradigm.
