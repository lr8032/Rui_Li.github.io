I am an assistant professor in the GCCIS PhD program at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, and earned my PhD in Computing and Information Sciences in 2013 from the Rochester Institute of Technology. I was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Rochester from 2014 to 2015. 

My research interests bridge the computational, statistical, cognitive behavior and biological sciences.
