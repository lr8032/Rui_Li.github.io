I am an associate professor in the GCCIS PhD Program at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), New York. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, China, and earned my PhD in Computing and Information Sciences in 2013 from RIT. I was a postdoctoral research associate in the department of Computer Science at the University of Rochester from 2014 to 2015. 

My research interests bridge the computational, statistical, cognitive behavior and biological sciences.  

I have opening for one motivated PhD student in the general areas of statistical machine learning, AI, and their applications in computational biology, medical image understanding and human visual attention.
