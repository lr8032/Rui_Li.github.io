I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a Ph.D. in Computing and Information Sciences in 2013. During my doctoral studies I was advised by Md. Ehsan Hoque, working in the RocHCI lab at the University of Rochester. After that I worked as a visiting assistant professor in the PhD program in the GCCIS at Rochester Institute of Technology.
